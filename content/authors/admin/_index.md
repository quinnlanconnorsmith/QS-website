I am a fisheries biologist with interests relating to the conservation and management of fish communities, the influence of climate change on the ecology, fisheries, and population dynamics within lake systems, human effects on ecosystems, and water column effects due to changing light conditions. I am currently beginning a Ph.D. program at the University of Wisconsin – Madison examining climate change and the thermal-optical habitat of walleye. My Master’s work focused on sportfish behavioral responses to a coarse woody habitat introduction in northern Wisconsin, a common management option in ecosystems influenced by increased lakeshore residential development. In the past, I have worked on predictive models to help conceptualize future ecological conditions on Lake Superior relating to changing water column light conditions given trends in increased wind over the lake surface and ice cover decline
