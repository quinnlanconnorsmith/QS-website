abstract: "Objective: Fish movements and distributions throughout an ecosystem are important for understanding ecological interactions, conservation, and management.
Coarse woody habitat (CWH) additions are a popular habitat enhancement tool that
can influence movements and distributions of fishes; however, behavioral responses
in relation to CWH additions are understudied. The objectives of our study were
to test for changes in habitat use and behavioral responses of Muskellunge Esox
masquinongy, Smallmouth Bass Micropterus dolomieu, and Walleye Sander vitreus
to CWH additions in a small inland northern lake over 3 years and to evaluate two
common forms of fish tracking to estimate daily movement of these fishes.
Methods: We used passive integrated transponder tag data collected continuously at
10 littoral sites and radiotelemetry data collected biweekly during the summer–fall
months prior (2017) and following (2018–2019) CWH addition to examine movement behaviors and estimate daily probability of movement for the three species
among lake habitats using multistate models.
Result: Walleye were the most likely to remain near CWH, followed by Smallmouth
Bass and Muskellunge. All species were more likely to move away from the modified
and unmodified littoral zones and were more likely to remain in the offshore zone.
Increased movement of fish may be in response to CWH creating a refuge for forage
fish and subsequent increases in prey search times.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that CWH additions may alter established speciesspecific annual movements, distributions, and habitat use to differing degrees in
ecosystems, as our results differ from other CWH studies. Methodologically, radiotagging was most effective for offshore tracking but most labor intensive. Novel passive integrated transponder arrays (less labor intensive once installed) worked well
to monitor movement between habitat types in shallow littoral areas. Long-term
monitoring of behavioral changes will be essential to assessing the stability changes
caused by these habitat alterations."
