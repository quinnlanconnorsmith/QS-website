abstract: "A lot can be learned by studying bright spots—defined as unexpected positive outcomes. In fields like public health, education, and oncology, identifying factors behind bright spots reveals previously unknown drivers of success that can be replicated elsewhere. This concept is being applied in conservation but is hampered by variations in definitions of bright spots and confusion with hotspots—sites with high absolute values of a metric. We developed a framework to clearly define and distinguish between hotspots (e.g., a wetland with high plant diversity) and bright spots (e.g., a biodiverse wetland in a housing development), which outperform conservation expectations. The framework is an iterative cycle, consisting of setting expectations for relative comparisons, classifying systems into bright, dark, hot, and cold categories, and digging deeper to reveal hidden mechanisms and opportunities for intervention. We drew on examples from diverse fields to demonstrate how our framework can generate new knowledge, identify potential interventions, and inform management priorities. Defining conservation and management expectations, often through predictive models, is essential to understanding drivers of success and fosters hypotheses about overlooked factors. Our framework can enhance ecological understanding, guide interventions, and help prioritize actions in conservation and natural resource management."
